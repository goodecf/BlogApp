# BlogApp

This application is an online blog application implemented in React in which users can create blog posts, search other blog posts, and create comments.

## Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) if not already installed.
3. Download the required node modules through `npm install`.
4. Start the backend and front end using `npm run dev`.

## Note

Due to [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) not supporting HTTPS requests, for now the application must be downloaded to run.
